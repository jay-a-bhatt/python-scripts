# python-scripts üêç
A collection of scripts I use to automate repetitive tasks.
## Script Descriptions

- compressed-to-cbz.py - renames .zip and .rar files to .cbz and .cbr respectively
- folder-to-cbz.py - converts a folder of images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) into .cbz files
- flatten-directory.py - brings all files in nested folders to the highest level directory
- remove-question-mark.py - removes question marks from filenames to ensure compatibility
